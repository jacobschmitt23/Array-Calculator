# Array-Calculator
<h3>Project Description</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>This program is an assembly-based implementation that performs various operations on matrices and arrays. It demonstrates a deep understanding of low-level programming concepts and practical expertise in algorithmic problem-solving using MIPS assembly language. The project includes features such as matrix mulitplication, matrix concatenation, constatn multiplication, value replacement, trace calculation, transposition, and matrix printing.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Download and install a MIPS simulator, I used QtSpim</li>
  <li>Open the <b>Array-Calculator.txt</b> file in your MIPS simulator</li>
  <li>Assemble the code</li>
  <li>Run the program in the simulator and follow the console outputs for the results</li>
  </ol>
